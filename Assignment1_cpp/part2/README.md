# Description


### Task 1 - Text Adeventure

In this lesson, you are going to create a very small text adventure narrative to practice the C++ that you have learned. The requirements are that you have a 'game loop' that handles 'input', 'update', and 'render' to display a linear narrative (you can go forward and backwards).

The point of this is to see how we can create a 'data-oriented' program (using text as input), as well as to get started programming in C++.

The journey that you create, however, is up to you!

### Assignment strategy

My suggested strategy for this assignment is to complete part 0 and part 1 first to help you get more comfortable with C++.


## How to compile and run your program

1. Your solution should compile using `g++ *.cpp -o prog` 
	- We should then be able to run your program given a text input file: `./prog story.txt`

# Submission/Deliverables

### Submission

- Commit all of your files to github, including any additional files you create.
- Do not commit any binary files unless told to do so.
- Do not commit any 'data' files generated when executing a binary.

### Deliverables

* You need to commit your code to this repository **and** a story.txt file.

# F.A.Q. (Instructor Anticipated Questions)

* Q: Can I expand on my story and the options?
  * A: Sure, have as much fun with it as you like!

# Found a bug?

If you found a mistake (big or small, including spelling mistakes) in this lab, kindly send me an e-mail. It is not seen as nitpicky, but appreciated! (Or rather, future generations of students will appreciate it!)

- Fun fact: The famous computer scientist Donald Knuth would pay folks one $2.56 for errors in his published works. [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check)]
- Unfortunately, there is no monetary reward in this course :)

# Going Further

- Try having the text print out one character at a time.
- Consider adding other attributtes and classes to make things more interactive like an acttual text adventure. That said, we're expecting this assignment to be relatively small :)
