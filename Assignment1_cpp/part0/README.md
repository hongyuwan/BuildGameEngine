# Description

For this first portion of the assignment you are going to do a 'follow along exercise' to practice getting started with C++. 

* Please watch all of the videos here: 
	1. [C++ Quick Start Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvv0ScY6vfd-R9N-vIDXdd4HO9IYATIxJ)
	2. [Classes and Compiling multiple files (program structure)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DZyFOa-PrQ&list=PLvv0ScY6vfd-R9N-vIDXdd4HO9IYATIxJ&index=3)
	3. [Read, write, and parse files(fstream, string, & stringstream)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAqX8YT4lHI&list=PLvv0ScY6vfd-R9N-vIDXdd4HO9IYATIxJ&index=4)
	4. [References, Pointers, and Dynamic Memory Allocation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2_z98wEU6M&list=PLvv0ScY6vfd-R9N-vIDXdd4HO9IYATIxJ&index=4)


# Task 1

In the [./src/main.cpp](./src/main.cpp) file you are going to commit code that matches what you learned in Part 1.

* The goal is to have similar code to the end of the first *C++ Quick Start Part 1* video.
* You can deviate if you like, but I would like to see .data(), .size(), and .push_back in your code so I know you know how to use std::vector.

This exercise will help you get started with C++ in the class. Note, that this is just a lightweight introduction to help you understand the different pieces of a C++ program.


## How to compile and run your program

1. You should be able to compile your program in the terminal from the root directory with:
    - `g++ ./src/main.cpp -o prog` 
    - or
    - `clang++ ./src/main.cpp -o prog`

# Submission/Deliverables

### Submission

- Commit all of your files to github, including any additional files you create.
- Do not commit any binary files unless told to do so.
- Do not commit any 'data' files generated when executing a binary.

### Deliverables

* In the [./src/main.cpp](./src/main.cpp) file, you should commit code that is similar to what you find in Part 1.

# F.A.Q. (Instructor Anticipated Questions)

* Q: N/A 
  * A: N/A

# Found a bug?

If you found a mistake (big or small, including spelling mistakes) in this lab, kindly send me an e-mail. It is not seen as nitpicky, but appreciated! (Or rather, future generations of students will appreciate it!)

- Fun fact: The famous computer scientist Donald Knuth would pay folks one $2.56 for errors in his published works. [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check)]
- Unfortunately, there is no monetary reward in this course :)
