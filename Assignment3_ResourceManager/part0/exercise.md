## Debugging

Edit the following lines below and list two things you learned about debugging (a command, a technique, a concept. etc.). This is a "for-credit" or "effort based" exercise meaning, I will not evaluate what I consider "difficult enough", I just want to know you learned or practiced two things about debugging and have knowledge of how to use a debugger.

1. We can use LLDB on macOS, it also has a gui using command "gui" which can be used more convinient.
2. LLDB has many command to use. Command "b" and "c" are very useful to set breakpoint or continue execution program.
