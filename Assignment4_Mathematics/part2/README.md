### Optional - SIMD

Professional math libraries make use of AVX, AVX2, and AVX512 instructions to achieve more parallelism. This is handled on the cpu side. Read through the AVX samples provided and run them. I encourage (though not required) you to try to include some of the AVX functionality in your TinyMath library (or perhaps implement TinyMathAccelerated3D.h).
